# heroku_metro

This repository provides the heroku deployement setup for my following repository!!

https://github.com/iCHAIT/Django-Delhi_Metro

There are still a few issues while deploying the site hence I have not provided the link yet but i'll share the link as soon as everything is up and running!!!


#### NOTE -

Though the original project is implemented using the MySQL database but for deploying it I used the Postgresql database as Heroku by defaults supports Postgresql so it was easier to deploy the database.


#### TODO -

* Directions2 page not working (Write a Stored Procedure Function to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.)

* Implement the deployement using MySQL.
